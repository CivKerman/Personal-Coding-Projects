        I am Timurs the Rabbit
    </h1>
        
    <p>Hi there!</p>
    <p>My name is Timurs the Rabbit and I am here to show you about the world of rabbits. I was
        born in a small town in England and I love to drink tea every morning. I do not like hunters and
        big dogs scare me. Here are the list of things what I like to do everyday:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>I like to eat grass</li>
        <li>I like to nibble on carrots</li>
        <li>Nap</li>
        <li>Relax on the seashore</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I hope you enjoy your stay! Love Timmurs the Rabbit.</p>
